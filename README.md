# Unexpected Loop Termination Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript loops involving unexpected termination. The `break` statement in the `while` loop might not always behave as intended, especially if the loop's conditions are dynamically altered during runtime.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` presents an improved solution.

## Bug Description
The provided `while` loop might not iterate through all intended values.  This is especially true in scenarios where the loop's exit condition is affected by asynchronous operations or external changes not directly anticipated. This can lead to incomplete processing or unexpected results.

## Solution
The solution focuses on improving the loop control for robustness, ensuring complete intended iteration.
